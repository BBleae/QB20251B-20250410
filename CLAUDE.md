## Web Development Guidelines

### HTML Standards

- Indent nested elements with 2 spaces
- Use lowercase for all HTML tags and attributes
- Always close void elements with trailing slash (e.g., `<img />`)
- Include alt text for all images

### File Organization
- Keep file names lowercase with descriptive names
- Use relative paths for internal links
- Organize images in dedicated subdirectories
- Maintain consistent folder hierarchy

### Link Management
- Use descriptive text for anchor links
- Implement proper path navigation between pages
- Validate all links and anchors before committing

### Character Encoding
- Use UTF-8 encoding for all HTML files
- Include appropriate meta tags for character encoding
- Use Chinese language tags where appropriate
